README.md

App based on React Native. Now available to tests only Android version.
So, you can try to use it. But you should change coords of targets to yours, becouse I use coords of objects near to my apartments.
Also I have idea to use Augments Reality for targets. But I think that I will do it only in new version, after release.

(MVP stage)
<pre>
	1. show current user coords
	2. circle of radar
	3. show users arrow at center of rarars circle
	4. words of world sides
	5. generate pseudo targets around user on start
	6. limit position of targets on circle by them border

*	7. animate targets and radar
	8. destroy target when you on it

	8. to think about screens of app
</pre>
